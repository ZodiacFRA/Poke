#### TODOs:
- decide if the pathfinder system is worth it, original goal was to have a class
capable of managing all the pathfinding queries to prevent duplication, and have a priority queue

If we go on with this optimization, we'll need to setup a way for the pathdinfing system to know if the map move has been done
-> in fact maybe the pathfinding system should handle itself the movement through the map wrapper
-> for now do nothing we'll do it if we really need to optimize the pathdinfing reruns

- decide how many server ticks should be done before sending the whole map again to every player to avoid network desyncs

#### Workarounds notes:
- Set a collision idx to specifiy if the pathfinder should ignore an entity or not
(collide with trees but not with players), needed for the "scan_zone" method to ignore
living entities. MAYBE entities should be separated from the map, however this would imply
to merge the living entities in the map before serializing it and would slow down the
(to be done) method of "find_specific_entity" needed by AIs to find an entity type
in their nearby area, as instead of searching near them we would need
to search the whole array of living entities and check the distance to their position each time
